# Flash Talks invitation

The London Genetics Network invites Early Career Researchers (ECRs) to submit for a flash talk presentation during the Annual Meeting 2022. Academics affiliated with an institution based in London or the surrounding areas are eligible to submit for the meeting. 
There will be two flash talk prizes for presentations on genetic research on complex traits and rare diseases for ECRs. The duration for each presentation will be 3 minutes including a maximum of two slides. 
Please send your submission for either Complex Traits or Rare Diseases (Title, Presenter, Institution, Abstract maximum 500 words) to londongeneticsnetwork@gmail.com by **Thursday 17 November 22 5:00pm.**
 

# Conference Care Fund 

The London Genetics Network invites applications for a Conference Care Fund for the Annual Meeting 2022 (funding for 3 applications available). Please find details below.

## Eligibility criteria: 
- I currently work PT/FT in human genetics research in London/the surrounding areas
- I have caring costs of a dependent eg payment to a childminder, nursery or Care provider for care outside of usual arrangements or I require travel costs for the dependent or I require a care to travel with me
- I will be attending the LGN 2022 annual meeting in person
- I would like to receive financial support through the Genetics Society Conference Care Fund
- I accept that the funds will be allocated randomly to three eligible researchers
- The Conference Care Fund of £90 will go towards costs for caring responsibilities that would be incurred to enable attendance on December 2nd 2022
- I acknowledge that successful applicants will be given funds following attendance at the meeting (i.e. after 2nd December)

If you meet the eligibility criteria and would like to apply, please send the following information to londongeneticsnetwork@gmail.com
1.    Full name and title
2.    Institution
3.    Position (e.g. PhD student/Postdoc/Lecturer)
4.    Brief description of caregiving situation and justification of the need for this fund (max 300 words).
5.    The following sentence: “I confirm that I meet the eligibility criteria for the Conference Care Fund”
and
“I agree for my name to be announced as a recipient of the Conference Care Fund at the meeting”
or
“I do not agree for my name to be announced as a recipient of the Conference Care Fund at the meeting”.
